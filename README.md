# rubin-style-dictionary

The rubin-style-dictionary is a distribution of design tokens that can be readily used in Rubin Observatory websites and apps. These tokens are encoded from the [Rubin Visual Identity Manual](https://docushare.lsst.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-37294/20210212%20Visual%20Identity%20Manual%20%e2%80%94V7.pdf), and include colors, typography, sizing, and assets. In addition to the core tokens, rubin-style-dictionary also includes derived tokens for specific reusable components, from buttons to navigation bars. These component tokens can be "themed," for example to provide a light and dark color palette.
