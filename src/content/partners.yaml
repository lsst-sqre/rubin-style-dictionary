            Vera C. Rubin Observatory is a Federal project jointly funded by the
            National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of Energy (DOE)
            Office of Science, with early construction funding received from private
            donations through the LSST Corporation. The NSF-funded LSST (now Rubin
            Observatory) Project Office for construction was established as an
            operating center under the management of the Association of Universities
            for Research in Astronomy (AURA). The DOE-funded effort to build the
            Rubin Observatory LSST Camera (LSSTCam) is managed by SLAC National
            Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC).

            NSF and DOE will continue to support Rubin Observatory in its operations
            phase to carry out the Legacy Survey of Space and Time. They will also
            provide support for scientific research with the data. During
            operations, NSF funding is managed by the Association of Universities
            for Research in Astronomy (AURA) under a cooperative agreement with NSF,
            and DOE funding is managed by SLAC under contract by DOE. Rubin
            Observatory is operated by NSF's NOIRLab and SLAC.
