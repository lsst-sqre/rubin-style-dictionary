Rubin Style Dictionary
######################

The |RSD| provides design tokens that can be used in Rubin Observatory design projects.
Built around `style-dictionary`_, these design tokens are available in a variety of formats that are ready to use in projects, such as CSS variables, JSON, and so on.

The design tokens are based on the |VIM|, with additional derived design tokens for specific components.

Rubin Style Dictionary is developed on GitHub at https://github.com/lsst-sqre/rubin-style-dictionary.
