   **Rubin Style Dictionary has moved to Squareone!.** You can find the code at https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/tree/main/packages/rubin-style-dictionary and the docs at https://squareone.lsst.io/packages/rubin-style-dictionary/index.html.

The |RSD| provides design tokens that can be used in Rubin Observatory design projects.
Built around `style-dictionary`_, these design tokens are available in a variety of formats that are ready to use in projects, such as CSS variables, JSON, and so on.

The design tokens are based on the |VIM|, with additional derived design tokens for specific components.

Rubin Style Dictionary is developed on GitHub at https://github.com/lsst-sqre/rubin-style-dictionary.
